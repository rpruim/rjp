\description{
This function returns the contents of an R help file to the console
as a character vector, printing it for easy reading.  It is intended for
dynamic documents where you want to show part of a help
file in the course of a tutorial. For this usage, you may wish to temporarily
assign \code{help_console} to \code{help} using non-printed code chunk.
}
\details{
This function uses non-exported functions in the \code{tools} package, so
it may not work with future updates.
